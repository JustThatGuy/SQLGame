1	5	The bird-woman creatures are mythological beings. They lure people with their hypnotic singing and abduct the for god knows what reason.\nI have a theory that they can't stand noise, that's why they come at night. So between the items in my shop, pick the one that is the loudest. It would have the highest number behind the name. Because of the loudness, it would be wise to protect your ears with some plugs. Good luck!

1	Discover the monster and its kill strategy, then obtain the necessary items.	Lately, I find my Inn covered in slime in the mornings. It is quite a hassle to clean it off every day. The village elders suspect that we have a snail problem. \r\n\r\nI would like you to get rid of these snails for me. Then I will tell you what you need to know. \r\n\r\nBut be aware that they are super fast. They will only slow down when they can eat some of our local lettuce. You can get that at the greengrocer outside. Add it to your inventory, then you can then lure the snails to the nearby saltmine. That will teach them...	12
2	Select some useful items for your journey and add them to your inventory	Looking around, you can see a lot of stuff that is washed ashore. As an aspiring adventurer, you will undoubtedly want to locate these treasures and deposit them in your trophy case.	\N
